The first two corner pieces have been printed.
Each one took about ten hours to finish.

The printed tray pieces fit well in the box and the holes have just the
right diameter for the majority of the bottles.

However I did notice too late, that some bottles have a little booklet
inside their labels. Those lables stick out a bit and keep the bottles
from sliding into the holder. For th√≥se bottles, the holes need to be bigger.
